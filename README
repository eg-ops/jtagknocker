@mainpage JTAG Knocker

[TOC]
@section intro Introduction
 Yet another JTAG finder, targeted for the ST STM32 Discovery development
 boards. It also functions as a USB JTAG adapter, which will be compatible
 with OpenOCD and have more features and be faster than a usb-blaster.

 Why? Because I don't have an arduino and I don't want to buy dedicated
 hardware. It's also a great learning experience on the inner workings
 of JTAG.

 The documentation is currently brief, but is an ongoing work in progress.
 Check out the code, run a `make docs` and look at `./doc/html/index.html`
 for way more detail.

@section qstart Quick Start

 If you've just cloned the repo run:
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  cd libopencm3 && make

 To get up and running, a `make` will build a binary in the `source`
 directory that can be uploaded to the Discovery board. You will need the
 arm-none-eabi gcc toolchain installed and a way to program the Discovery
 board. For more information see @subpage building.
