Usage
 Wire port D pins to each pin to test on the target board, starting at PD0
 (pin 1). If you don't want to damage the target board and/or the STM32,
 place 330 ohm resistors in series with each connection to limit current to
 10mA.

 Connect the development board to a serial interface and open up a
 terminal. Hit Enter to get a prompt.
